# Visual Quality & Behavior Audit — 2026-04-03

**Status:** Active checklist. Work through each item one by one.

---

## A. Likely Misbehaviors

- [x] **1. Viewport resize breaks particle text layout** ✅ Fixed in `90d6f6a`
  Base positions stored immutably; `setTargetsForPhase()` rescales via ratio on resize/orientationchange (200ms debounce). All three formations (crosshair, text, tagline) adapt to current viewport.

- [x] **2. Performance scaling can break text legibility** ✅ Fixed in `c6d0d99`
  Dynamic `_targetFloor` in ParticleSystem ensures `_activeCount` never drops below the number of targeted particles. Floor updates per phase: 8K (logo/text), 13K (combined).

- [x] **3. Force-completing the intro on scroll is jarring** ✅ Fixed in `8eafaf8`
  Scroll during intro triggers `intro.timeScale(5)` instead of `intro.progress(1)`. All phases play at 5x speed (~2.4s) — no teleportation. Early returns prevent seek contention during fast-forward. `onLeave` kills any zombie timeline.

- [x] **4. Font race condition in `textToPointCloud`** ✅ Fixed in `8215df5`
  `await document.fonts.ready` added before text point cloud generation. Inter is guaranteed loaded before canvas rendering.

- [x] **5. Bloom absence changes visual tuning** ✅ Fixed in `095eed4`
  `uNoBloom` uniform triggers 2.5x alpha boost and raised clamp ceilings (0.2→0.5, 0.35→0.7) when bloom fails. Engine detects absence at init and runtime, notifies material via `setNoBloom()`.

- [x] **6. `prefers-reduced-motion` is nearly ignored** ✅ Fixed in `cc63931`
  Full reduced-motion support: instant text+tagline formation via `teleportToTargets()`, zero drift, frozen particles. Scroll dissolve preserved (user-initiated). GSAP timeline skipped entirely.

---

## B. Visual Quality Gaps

- [x] **7. Text particles are flat — zero depth** ✅ Fixed in `b0de361`
  ±0.3 z-jitter added to both `svgToPointCloud` and `textToPointCloud`. Text formations now have subtle 3D volume. Jitter preserved through `rescaleCloud()`.

- [x] **8. Tagline particle density is likely too low to read** ✅ Fixed in `5683718`
  `TAGLINE_POINT_COUNT` increased from 5,000 to 8,000 (~154 particles/char). Combined phase floor now 16K (8K text + 8K tagline).

- [x] **9. No loading state — cold void on entry** ✅ Fixed in `51a7415`
  CSS-only cosmic shimmer pulse on `.hero-section::before` — radial gradient centered at logo formation point, breathing at 2.5s cycle. Fades out via `data-engine-ready` attribute when particles start rendering. Reduced-motion: static glow.

- [x] **10. Edge glow is decorative but static** ✅ Fixed in `6d771c5`
  CSS breathing animation (`edge-breathe` 5s cycle via scale/brightness). Scroll-driven opacity fade in both normal and reduced-motion paths. Disabled animation under `prefers-reduced-motion`.

- [x] **11. No particle trails** ✅ Fixed in `494ca41`
  Velocity-based trail effect in material shader. Fast particles scale 1.5x larger and get alpha boost. Visual streak during convergence, fades as particles settle. Vel buffer uploaded each CPU frame.

- [x] **12. Default cursor** ✅ Fixed in `04fd6cb`
  SVG crosshair cursor via data URI — center dot + cross lines in celestial-dim color. Desktop only via `@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)`. Fallback: built-in `crosshair`.

- [ ] **13. Scroll indicator is generic**
  The down-arrow SVG with pulse is functional but forgettable. Could be more integrated with the particle system — particles forming the arrow, or a subtle particle stream suggesting downward motion.

- [ ] **14. No transition between hero and content**
  Hero dissolve works, but then you hit blank placeholders. The spec describes a particle river guiding downward, parallax depth layers, color temperature shift. Currently the cinematic momentum crashes into nothing. Even before full section content, the transition needs work.

## C. Mobile-Specific Concerns

- [ ] **15. Touch interaction is basic**
  The spec defines: touch-hold for gravitational well, touch-drag for cosmic wake, pinch for depth zoom. Currently `touchmove` just maps finger position to particle attraction (same as mouse). All three spec interactions are missing.

- [ ] **16. Gyroscope mapping is a rough approximation**
  `CosmosCanvas.tsx:74-75` — beta offset of -45 assumes phone held at ~45°. Breaks when user is lying down or holding at steep angle. Needs calibration on first read or adaptive centering.

- [ ] **17. `hero-logo-space` sizing mismatch**
  `globals.css:95` — `min(200px, 50vw)` is a fixed spacer. But actual particle text spans a viewport-responsive width from `getResponsiveDimensions()`. Spacer doesn't correspond to where particles are in 3D space. On some devices, elements may overlap or drift from the visual particle formation.

- [ ] **18. No haptic feedback**
  For a premium mobile experience, subtle haptic pulses (one when particles lock into logo, another for text formation) would add a physical dimension. iOS and Android both support this.

## D. Polish & Craft Details

- [ ] **19. No favicon from the brand mark**
  `public/logo/thefixer-mark.svg` exists but the default Next.js `favicon.ico` is still in place. The crosshair mark should be the favicon.

- [ ] **20. Metadata is minimal**
  Missing: Open Graph tags (og:image, og:title, og:description), Twitter card, theme-color meta, Apple touch icon. Enterprise clients share links — the preview card matters.

- [ ] **21. No `contain` or compositing hints**
  `.cosmos-canvas` and `.content-layer` lack `contain: layout style paint` or `will-change` properties. Explicit hints help the GPU compositor, especially on mobile.

- [ ] **22. `CosmosBackground` wrapper is thin**
  Just a dynamic import wrapper. Could handle: fallback UI while engine loads, error boundary if WebGL2 fails, static image fallback for devices with no GPU.

- [ ] **23. No graceful degradation for very old devices**
  If both WebGPU and WebGL2 fail, the user sees a black void forever. No fallback content, static image, or message.

## E. Architecture Observations

- [ ] **24. `cpuAnimate` trig math is heavy per-frame**
  6 `Math.sin/cos` + 3 `Math.sqrt` per particle per frame. At 30K × 60fps = 1.8M sin/cos calls/second on main thread. Viable but leaves little headroom. Lookup tables or batching would help.

- [ ] **25. Position buffer uploaded fully every frame**
  `posBuffer.needsUpdate = true` every frame uploads ~360KB (30K particles) to GPU. Standard approach but could optimize with partial updates.

- [ ] **26. `textToPointCloud` sampling is non-deterministic**
  Fisher-Yates with `Math.random()` produces different distributions per call. If called again on resize, particles scatter and re-settle rather than smoothly adapting. Should seed the RNG or cache the result.
